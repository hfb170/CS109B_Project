Due to space and upload limitiation, the data cannot be loaded in the repository. Instead, a github folder was created that includes the following folders:
1 - Actual posters used for training
2 - Actual posters used for test
3 - Preprocessedpickle dump files used for the deep learning
4 - Raw data files that include the meta data
5 - Derived data that are used as secondary data sources including:

  a - encoded genre labels
  b- File inventory for the posters
  c- Extracted color statistics features extracted from the posters
  d - cleaned data removing inconsistent records which turned to be very few

The contenets of this folder are minimal and does not represent the actual data
